## Install

### Composer

To get started using yaml-lint in a project, install it with Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev j13k/yaml-lint
```

It can then be run from the project's `vendor/bin` directory.

To set up yaml-lint globally, install it in the Composer home directory:

```bash
composer global require j13k/yaml-lint
```

It can then be run from the `bin` directory of Composer home (typically  `~/.composer/vendor/bin`).

### Binary

A binary edition , `yaml-lint.phar`, is available for download
with [each release](https://github.com/j13k/yaml-lint/releases). This embeds the latest stable version of the Symfony
Yaml component that is current at the time of the release.

The binary can be conveniently installed using [PHIVE](https://phar.io/):

```
phive install yaml-lint
```

### Docker

yaml-lint is bundled in the [phpqa Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jakzal/phpqa/), which provides a suite of
static analysis tools for PHP. See the [phpqa project](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa) for [installation
and usage instructions](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa#running-tools).
