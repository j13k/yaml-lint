  input source      Path to file(s), or "-" to read from standard input

  -q, --quiet       Restrict output to syntax errors
  -t, --parse-tags  Enable parsing of custom YAML tags (symfony/yaml 3+ only)
  -h, --help        Display this help
  -V, --version     Display application version
```

## Install

### Composer

To get started using yaml-lint in a project, install it with Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev j13k/yaml-lint
```

It can then be run from the project's `vendor/bin` directory.

To set up yaml-lint globally, install it in the Composer home directory:

```bash
composer global require j13k/yaml-lint
```

It can then be run from the `bin` directory of Composer home (typically  `~/.composer/vendor/bin`).

### Binary

A binary edition , `yaml-lint.phar`, is available for download with [each release](https://github.com/j13k/yaml-lint/releases). This embeds the latest stable version of the Symfony Yaml component that is current at the time of the release.

The binary can be conveniently installed using [PHIVE](https://phar.io/):

```bash
phive install yaml-lint
```

#### Verifying Signatures

Release binaries are signed with GPG. To verify the signature:

1. Download both `yaml-lint.phar` and `yaml-lint.phar.asc` from the [releases page](https://github.com/j13k/yaml-lint/releases)

2. Import the public key:

   ```bash
   gpg --recv-keys 38A182AB413064D7
   ```

   Or download it from this repository:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j13k/yaml-lint/master/j13k_users_noreply_github_com.pub
   gpg --import j13k_users_noreply_github_com.pub
   ```

3. Verify the signature:

   ```bash
   gpg --verify yaml-lint.phar.asc yaml-lint.phar
   ```

   You should see: `Good signature from "John Fitzpatrick (Software signing key) <j13k@users.noreply.github.com>"`

### Docker

yaml-lint is bundled in the [phpqa Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jakzal/phpqa/), which provides a suite of
static analysis tools for PHP. See the [phpqa project](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa) for [installation
